## About data files in MS-RIDD project
After a data analysis, MS-RIDD generates several data files 
namely "analysis_table.pkl", "cid_result.pickle", "extracted_msms.pickle", "graph_info.pickle", "oad_result.pickle", and "structure_info.pickle".

All these files should be in a same directory to open a MS-RIDD project.
