# MS-RIDD: Mass Spectrometry Radical Induced Dissociation Dicipherer - A software for spectra analysis of radical induced dissociation
The current program supports tandem MS/MS spectra analysis for oxygen attachment dissociation, which is one of the radical induced dissociation.

The assembly is licensed under the CC-BY 4.0.

Please contact Haruki Uchino (haruki-uchino@keio.jp) for feedback, bug reports, and questions.

## Usage
### Preparation of input data for MS-RIDD



For the usage of MS-DIAL, please see the tutorial page: https://mtbinfo-team.github.io/mtbinfo.github.io/

***

## About data files in MS-RIDD project
After a data analysis, MS-RIDD generates several data files 
namely "analysis_table.pkl", "cid_result.pickle", "extracted_msms.pickle", "graph_info.pickle", "oad_result.pickle", and "structure_info.pickle".

All these files should be in a same directory to open a MS-RIDD project.

License
Matplotlib only uses BSD compatible code, and its license is based on the PSF license. See the Open Source Initiative licenses page for details on individual licenses. Non-BSD compatible licenses (e.g., LGPL) are acceptable in matplotlib toolkits. For a discussion of the motivations behind the licencing choice, see Licenses.

Copyright Policy
John Hunter began matplotlib around 2003. Since shortly before his passing in 2012, Michael Droettboom has been the lead maintainer of matplotlib, but, as has always been the case, matplotlib is the work of many.

Prior to July of 2013, and the 1.3.0 release, the copyright of the source code was held by John Hunter. As of July 2013, and the 1.3.0 release, matplotlib has moved to a shared copyright model.

matplotlib uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to matplotlib. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the matplotlib source code, in its entirety, is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire matplotlib Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the matplotlib repositories.

The Matplotlib Development Team is the set of all contributors to the matplotlib project. A full list can be obtained from the git version control logs.
